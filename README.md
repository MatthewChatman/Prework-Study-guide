# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

- My motivation was to complete a web page that would apply the basic knowledge and skills required to work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- I built this project as a practical introductory exercise to apply the expansive array of skills involved for web development.
- The problems addressed by this project are helpful tips and hints about the basics of web development because this infomation can be difficult to memorize and will only be retained through continuous practice.
- I learned how to work in Git Bash, VS Code, set up an IDE, generate and assign SSH keys, the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, defined terminology such as arrays, loops and functions, learned about Gitflow and version control.
